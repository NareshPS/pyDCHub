# Format of user commands:
# Name = Who Order Type Context Details
# Name is the internal name of the user command
# If the command is related to a bot, it should be in the form:
#  BotName$CommandName
# Who decides who gets the command, a combination of the following
#  1 - User
#  2 - Op
#  4 - Account holder with bot name (or command name if no related bot) in args
#  8 - Bot with bot name must be logged in
#  So a Who of 11 means that the user must be logged in, the user must be an 
#   op, and the related bot must be logged in.
# Order is the order of the commands sent to the user, commands are sent in
#  ascending order (this can be an integer or a float
# For Type, Context, and Details, see:
#  http://dcplusplus.sourceforge.net/wiki/index.php/UserCommand%20command
# For Details, note that py-dchub already does translations for $ and |.
# See the usercommand file in the examples folder for examples
