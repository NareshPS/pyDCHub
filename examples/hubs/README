This directory contains subclasses of DCHub, which change the hub's default 
behavior.  While you can use bots to accomplish pretty much anything you can 
with subclasses, often the subclassing method is simpler, since it doesn't
involve wrapping functions, and you don't have to worry about loading/reloading.

To use one of these subclasses, move it to the directory with DCHub.py, and run
it instead of DCHub.py.
